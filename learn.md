Onboarding and Learning path
============================

Hello and welcome to your web developper journey.

Goal of this framework is to enable you as a developper and give you some ideas and resources to be better at your job.

Web development has become way more demanding than it was by the past and the numbers of tools involved in the making of a website has gone off the chart.

It can be cumbersome an overwhelming wanting to be good at everything, to know about every bit of tech involved. Especially in an evergrowing environement.

So in order to be efficient in learning how to become a better developper and a good web employee at Decathlon here are some tools / framework to help you grow.

Overview
--------

In order to rely on up to date elements, we will use a popular **roadmaps** system: https://roadmap.sh/frontend ([repo](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap)). The goal is not to be an expert in everything, but to know the whole topology of this map and to know which path we want to follow in priority. 

In the context of working in ecommerce at Decathlon, some of the road stops will be mandatory.

There is also a good complementary resource here: https://andreasbm.github.io/web-skills/ that could be used in parallel.

**Keep in mind that it is important to identify and name the topics that will move us forward on our path.**

Another advice is that whatching videos and reading articles will not make you learn efficiently (at least yet). It requires a lot of discipline, that we mostly forgot since we are not in school anymore. It is important that you practice the skills you learned and **keep a log of what you learned**. Some people do that on paper, some thinks that learning in the open in a good practice, it has never been more easy to publish content on the internet, so please keep a trace of what you learned. And it can be interesting for you to share it.

Basics
------

Before diving into web development some knowledge are absolutely mandatory to work in a tech environement.

**Work your english**

You will work with people that dont speak, write nor read your language, your coding and documentation work will be entirely in english. So it of primary importance that you become good at it. That require time and dedication, but there is some tools to help you ([deepl](https://www.deepl.com) can be quite easyly integrated to your daily flow) and you can see with your manager to get real english courses.

**Work your writing**

Thanks to the internationnal pandemic most of our work and exchanges have become asynchronous. This is a chance because scaling up companies, business units, teams, software... requires the creation of a culture of writing.
Writing impactful content (content that is read and recognised) is not automatic and requires practice and repeat. Starting now, everything should be a good reason to write in english, even if your recipient speak the same language than you. This will create a group momentum and a shared sense of accomplishment.

**Work your reading**

With a lot of writing comes a lot of reading, hoppefully practicing your english writting skill will make you better at reading english content.
But reading is also a skills that needs to be trained. Interesting and valuable content are most of the time bigger in size than a series of tweets. So it is important that you build resilience to long reads.
You will learn most of your future skills in long reads (in english). So make it a habit, an dedicate some time of your schedule to read. You can also build a read list in order to always have something ready.

**IDE and communication tools** 

Whatever your IDE of choice, you need to be proefficient with it. Start learning keyboard shortcuts and how to use those on a daily basis. Share what you discover, your collegues can benefit from your learnings.

Being really efficient in spreadsheets and slides tools can also be a huge boost in your career evolution, as they will be your primary ways of communication with your top management.


**Git**

Regardless of what your dev job will preciselly be, almost everything we do relies on code, even infrastructure. As we work in distributed teams Git is at the core of what we do. Is is **mandatory** that you have a good comprehension of what it is and how it works, and how your team workflow relies on it. 
Hopefully there are standards and conventions, you need to be aware of those and their values.
